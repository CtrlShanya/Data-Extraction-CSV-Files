# Data-Extraction-CSV-Files

This is a preliminary attempt to extract ordered data from '.CSV' files using Python3 (specifically 3.5.2)

I am using _time_ , _pandas_ and _docx_ library of python.
My CSV file already has data in it extracted from books on Indian Astronomy.

The code prompts the user to put in the code for the data that is to be extracted, and the summarises the results in a new word file that the user can name before it gets saved.
